Contributor Covenant – Community Code of Conduct (v3.0)
Our Commitment
We are dedicated to building a community that is inclusive, respectful, and safe for everyone.

Our goal is to foster a space where all individuals are treated with dignity and respect, regardless of race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, appearance, neurodiversity, disability, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, beliefs, nationality, background, education level, or socio-economic status. Everyone who participates in this community and abides by these principles is welcome.

Positive Conduct We Support
Recognizing that cultural norms and communication styles differ, we commit to mindful, respectful, and value-driven interactions.

We strive to:

Align with the mission and purpose of the community in our behavior and contributions.

Communicate kindly, honestly, and respectfully.

Listen to and acknowledge differing perspectives and experiences.

Take responsibility for our actions and the effect they have on others.

Offer and accept constructive feedback in good faith.

Make amends when we cause harm.

Foster a supportive, sustainable environment for all community members.

Unacceptable Behavior
To maintain a healthy community, we agree to avoid the following actions. These include both the behavior itself and any threat or promotion of it:

Harassment: Ignoring clear boundaries or giving unwanted attention after being asked to stop.

Personal attacks: Using insulting or degrading language toward individuals or groups.

Discrimination: Judging people based on traits or identities they cannot change.

Inappropriate conduct: Making sexually suggestive or intimate remarks where they are not appropriate.

Breach of privacy: Sharing someone’s private information without consent.

Endangerment: Threatening or inciting violence or harm against others.

Any other action that undermines the safety or integrity of the community.

Other Prohibited Activities
Impersonation: Falsely claiming to be someone else or misrepresenting your identity.

Plagiarism: Using or sharing content without giving credit to the original creator.

Unsolicited promotion: Posting advertisements or marketing content outside of acceptable community contexts.

Irresponsible content: Sharing content that promotes or enables restricted behaviors listed above.

Reporting Issues
Conflicts may happen, even with the best intentions. Not every disagreement is a code of conduct violation, but harmful behavior should be addressed.

If you witness or experience a violation, report it by emailing: conduct@ethicalsource.dev

Community moderators will investigate reports seriously and confidentially. Investigations may involve reviewing communication logs or talking with involved parties. The process will be as transparent as possible while maintaining safety and privacy. Any actions taken will prioritize the community’s well-being and the fair treatment of all involved.

Repairing Harm – Enforcement Process
If a violation occurs, the following steps (called the enforcement ladder) guide how we respond and seek repair. Moderators may skip steps depending on severity.

1. Warning
What happened: A first-time or lower-impact issue.

Outcome: A private written warning.

Repair: Acknowledgment of impact, possibly an apology or further clarification of boundaries.

2. Temporary Restrictions
What happened: A more serious issue, or a repeat of past behavior.

Outcome: A time-limited restriction from certain interactions or channels.

Repair: Reflection, accountability, and preparation for reengagement.

3. Temporary Suspension
What happened: Serious violation or continued misconduct after prior warnings.

Outcome: Temporary removal from community spaces.

Repair: Demonstrating readiness to return by meeting stated conditions.

4. Permanent Ban
What happened: Ongoing or extremely harmful behavior.

Outcome: Full removal from all community areas.

Repair: Not applicable due to the severity of the harm.

Where This Applies
This code is in effect across all official community spaces. It also applies when someone is representing the community publicly—such as via official email, social media, or at events.
